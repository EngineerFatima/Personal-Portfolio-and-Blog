              <p>The art of self defense</p>
            </div>
            <p>Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as self-defense; military and law enforcement applications; competition; physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage</p>
            <p>Martial arts is very beneficial because it helps to build your mental strength as it requires focus and discipline. As much as strength comes into play, you will also be taught that strategy is equally important. Many times, you may get knocked down and might feel discouraged, but the discipline involved in classes such as MMA and Muay Thai, force you to build a thicker skin and the inner strength to get back up and keep going. This helps you increase your confidence and mental strength.</p>
